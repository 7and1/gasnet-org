Topology dictates congestion behavior. Record how your fabric is wired.

## Example topology factors

- Fat-tree vs. dragonfly
- Shared rails or multi-rail routing
- Rack-level oversubscription ratios

## Diagnostic hints

- Compare intra-rack vs. inter-rack latency deltas.
- Check whether collective performance aligns with topology expectations.
- Note any hop-count or routing asymmetry.
