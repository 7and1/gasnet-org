Runtime integration is where production environments diverge from lab
benchmarks. Capture operational reality.

## Integration points

- Job launchers and resource managers
- Container or bare-metal provisioning
- Performance counters and telemetry

## Risk mitigation

- Validate endpoint discovery across multi-rail networks
- Record failure modes under large-scale job starts
- Track fallback paths when preferred transports are unavailable
