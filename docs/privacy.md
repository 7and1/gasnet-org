## Overview

Gasnet.org is committed to protecting your privacy. This document explains how we handle data on this website.

## Analytics

We use privacy-focused analytics to understand how our documentation is used and to improve content quality.

### What We Collect

Our analytics solution collects **only** the following anonymized data:

- Page views (which pages are visited)
- Referrer (how you arrived at our site)
- Browser type and version
- Operating system
- Screen resolution
- Country (based on IP address, not stored)

### What We Don't Collect

We deliberately **do not** collect:

- Personal identifiers (names, emails, addresses)
- IP addresses (only used for country-level geolocation)
- Tracking cookies or persistent identifiers
- Cross-site tracking data
- Behavioral profiles or fingerprinting

### Data Storage

- All analytics data is stored on our own servers
- No data is shared with third-party services
- Data retention period: 90 days (aggregate statistics only)
- No data is sold or monetized

## Local Search

The on-site search function runs entirely in your browser. Your search queries are:

- Processed locally using JavaScript
- Never sent to external servers
- Not logged or stored

## Cookies

This site uses:

- **Essential cookies**: Required for site functionality (e.g., language preferences)
- **No tracking cookies**: We do not use cookies for cross-site tracking or advertising

## Do Not Track

Our analytics respects the Do Not Track (DNT) browser setting. If you have DNT enabled, your visit will not be counted in analytics statistics.

## Opting Out

### Analytics Opt-Out

You can opt out of analytics by:

1. **Browser Setting**: Enable Do Not Track in your browser settings
2. **Browser Extension**: Use a privacy-focused extension that blocks analytics scripts

### Disabling JavaScript

If you disable JavaScript in your browser, analytics will not function. The site remains fully functional without JavaScript enabled.

## Third-Party Links

This site may contain links to external resources (e.g., research papers, GitHub repositories). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those external sites.

## Children's Privacy

Our services are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) - EU/UK
